      <description>Simple exploits against targets under WINE In this part of the series, I will demonstrate some simple exploits against Windows executables running under WINE. I will assume basic knowledge on exploiting stack overflows on the x86 architecture. Additionally, some knowledge of return-oriented-programming (ROP) or return-to-libc exploitation techniques is beneficial. Out of convenience I&amp;rsquo;m using pwntools for the development of the exploits, but every other toolkit will work as well. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m showing some rather simple task in some detail to demonstrate the use of Linux tools against windows binaries.</description>

      <description>Examining the WINE environment Intro This text is the first of a series that details the exploitation of Windows software running under WINE. My focus is on CTF-like settings, but most information should apply in other situations as well.
In this text i concentrate on general properties of processes running in a WINE environment, especially on the aspects that are relevant for exploit development. I will take a deeper look into actual exploitation and some WINE specific tricks in the later parts.</description>
