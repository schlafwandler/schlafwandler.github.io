      <description>Examining the WINE environment Intro This text is the first of a series that details the exploitation of Windows software running under WINE. My focus is on CTF-like settings, but most information should apply in other situations as well.
In this text i concentrate on general properties of processes running in a WINE environment, especially on the aspects that are relevant for exploit development. I will take a deeper look into actual exploitation and some WINE specific tricks in the later parts.</description>
